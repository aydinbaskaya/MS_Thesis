## Genetic Algorithm Optimization with MATLAB

* GA is part of a group of stochastic algorithm
* Here, our aim is to minimize predetermined objective function, which is `total_mass=mass_structure+mass_epoxy+mass_magnet+mass_copper+mass_steel` in our matlab .m file
* For this purpose MATLAB `optimtool()` function and its gui will be used
