# Master Thesis Studies

In this section i'll try to summary my works and main ideas of the articles which i've read during my thesis preparation process.

To do this,i'll try to update this repository 2-3 times a week. Apart from this readme file, 
you can check out the articles in the related document repository, namely "MS_Thesis/Modular Generators/Documents" directory
